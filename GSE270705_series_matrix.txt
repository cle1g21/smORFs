!Series_summary	"Background The characteristics of a tumor are largely determined by its interaction with the surrounding micro-environment (TME). TME consists of both cellular and non-cellular components. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major component of the TME. They are a source of many secreted factors that influence the survival and progression of tumors as well as their response to drugs. Identification of markers either overexpressed in CAFs or unique to CAFs would pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies that in combination with conventional chemotherapy are likely to have  better patient outcome.  Methods  Fibroblasts have been derived from Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. RNA from these has been used  to perform a transcriptome analysis in order to get a comparative profile of normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts.  Results  The study has identified 818 differentially expressed mRNAs and 17 lincRNAs between normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts.   Also, 15 potential lincRNA-miRNA-mRNA combinations have been identified which may be potential biomarkers.  Conclusions Identified differentially expressed markers between normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts would help in CAFs/derived factors targeted therapy in combination with conventional therapy. However, this would in future need more experimental validation."
!Series_overall_design	"In order to get a comparison of the transcriptoome from normal and cancer associated fibroblasts biopsy samples from control (benign prostatic hyperplasia/BPH) and prostate cancer were obtained. Fibroblasts were derived from these tissues. Total RNA was isolated from the fibroblasts and subjected to RNA-seq using Illumina 2000 platform. Differentially expressed mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs were identified between the two groups."
