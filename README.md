# MRes-Big-Data-Biology
Research project under supervision of Owen Rackham

Overall aim is to take all nuORFs identified from S. P. Chothani paper and see if any of these nuORF genes are dysregulated in cancer (TCGA data).

This will identify mRNA nuORFs that are highly expressed in disease compared to healthy -> we can say that the nuORF is involved and likely protein specific for that disease.

R scripts found in TCGA folder.
