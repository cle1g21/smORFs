# MRes-Big-Data-Biology
Research project under supervision of Owen Rackham

Overall aim is to take all nuORFs identified from S. P. Chothani paper -> take 50-100 datasets from GEO -> see if any of these nuORF genes are disregulated in the test vs control samples.

This will identify mRNA nuORFs that are highly expressed in disease compared to healthy -> we can say that the nuORF is invovled and likely protein speicfic for that disease.
